# Your Boss Kicked Your Ass

* Connect to your cam hermes email and/or gmail account.
* Check incoming mails every x minutes.
* Call/Message you if you received an email from your boss.  
* If you do not read your boss' email, the program will keep calling you every x minutes. 

# Voice call service 
I use messagebird as the voice call service provider and each voice call to UK numbers costs 2 pences. An alternative provider could be Twilio.

# Installation 
1. Copy or clone this repository 
2. Edit your info in config.json (camid, mail list, phone number, messagebird_api_serect, etc.)
3. Run main.exe
